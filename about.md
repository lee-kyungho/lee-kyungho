Research interests: Applied microeconomics, IO, econometrics/machine-learning for unstructured data and policy evaluation

Hi, I am a PhD candidate in economics at Yale. I study how modern technologies shape industry competition and explore effective policies to address the resulting challenges. In my research, I use unstructured data by developing novel empirical approaches and apply econometric models to examine positive and normative aspects.
