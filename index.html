  Basically Basic is a [Jekyll theme](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/themes/) meant as a substitute for the default --- [Minima](https://github.com/jekyll/minima). Conventions and features found there are fully supported by **Basically Basic**, with a few enhancements thrown in for good measure:

  - label: "Git-hub"
    icon: github
    url: "https://github.com/lee-kyungho"
  - label: "CV"
    icon: pdf
    url: ""
